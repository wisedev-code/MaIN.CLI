# MaIN.CLI
CLI Project for MaIN.NET package

⚠️WARNING! WORK IN PROGRESS!⚠️

This project is currently under construction. Things can change between commits.
Not all functionalities from original CLI are migrated - if you prefer stability, use the old one for time being.

# Installation:
It is **REALLY** not recommended to use this CLI until there is a stable release but if you want, here are some setup steps
- clone this repo
- copy infer and server catalogues to main directory (they're too big to comfortably put in version control)
- open the solution
- MaIN.CLI project is the core functionality. 
- MaIN.Installer is, well, installer.
- to install CLI from project build the installer project as a Release and run the Installer
